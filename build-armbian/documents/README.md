# Armbian Build and Usage Guide

View Chinese description | [查看中文说明](README.cn.md)

GitHub Actions is a service launched by Microsoft that provides a virtual server environment with excellent performance configurations. Based on this, you can build, test, package, and deploy projects. For public repositories, it can be used free of charge with no time limit, and each build can last up to 6 hours. This is sufficient for compiling Armbian (usually we can complete a compilation within about 3 hours). Sharing is just for the purpose of exchanging experiences, please understand any shortcomings, do not initiate any harmful attacks on the network, and do not misuse GitHub Actions.

## 4. Customization instructions for personalized Armbian system files

The system compilation process is controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. There are other .yml files in the workflows directory that implement different functions. The system is compiled in real time using Armbian's current official code, and related parameters can be referred to the official documentation.

```yaml
- name: Compile Armbian [ ${{ inputs.set_release }} ]
  id: compile
  if: ${{ steps.down.outputs.status }} == 'success' && !cancelled()
  run: |
    # Compile method and parameter description: https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Options
    cd build/
        ./compile.sh RELEASE=${{ inputs.set_release }} BOARD=odroidn2 BRANCH=current BUILD_MINIMAL=no \
                      BUILD_ONLY=default HOST=armbian BUILD_DESKTOP=no EXPERT=yes KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
                      COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE="sha" SHARE_LOG=yes
    echo "status=success" >> ${GITHUB_OUTPUT}
```

## 5. Compile the system

There are many ways to compile the system. You can set up timed compilation, manual compilation, or set some specific events to trigger the compilation. Let's start with simple operations.

### 5.1 Manual Compilation

In your repository's navigation bar, click the Actions button, then sequentially click on Build armbian > Run workflow > Run workflow to start the compilation. Wait for approximately 3 hours. The compilation is completed once all processes have ended. The illustration is as follows:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163203938-e7762b09-e6b8-4cf5-b1f1-9c67c1a29953.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204044-9c7a7429-47ee-4fce-b7dd-e217bebf6133.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204127-6b16b558-7e78-4c22-a28a-7b37b5a34fa3.png width="300" />
</div>

### 5.2 Scheduled Compilation

In the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file, use Cron to set scheduled compilation. The five different positions respectively represent minutes (0 - 59) / hours (0 - 23) / date (1 - 31) / month (1 - 12) / day of the week (0 - 6)(Sunday - Saturday). Set the time by modifying the value at different positions. The system uses UTC standard time by default, please convert according to the time zone of your country.

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 17 * * *'
```

### 5.3 Customizing Default System Configuration

The default system configuration information is recorded in the [model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf) file, in which the `BOARD` name must be unique.

For those with `BUILD` value as `yes`, they are part of the default packaged systems for the box, these boxes can be used directly. Those with the default value as `no` are not packaged. To use the unpackaged boxes, you need to download the same `FAMILY` packaged system (recommend downloading `5.15/5.4` kernel system), after writing to `USB`, you can open `USB's boot partition` on the computer, modify `FDT's dtb name` in `/boot/uEnv.txt` file, to adapt to other boxes in the list.

When compiling locally, specify with the `-b` parameter. When compiling in Actions on github.com, specify with the `armbian_board` parameter. Using `-b all` means to package all devices where `BUILD` is `yes`. When packaging with a specified `BOARD` parameter, it can be packaged whether `BUILD` is `yes` or `no`. For example: `-b r68s_s905x3-tx3_s905l3a-cm311`.

## 6. Saving the System

The system save setting is also controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. We upload the compiled system to the Releases provided by the official GitHub via script automatically.

```yaml
- name: Upload Armbian image to Release
  uses: ncipollo/release-action@main
  if: ${{ env.PACKAGED_STATUS }} == 'success' && !cancelled()
  with:
    tag: Armbian_${{ env.ARMBIAN_RELEASE }}_${{ env.PACKAGED_OUTPUTDATE }}
    artifacts: ${{ env.PACKAGED_OUTPUTPATH }}/*
    allowUpdates: true
    token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    body: |
      These are the Armbian OS image
      * OS information
      Default username: root
      Default password: 1234
      Install command: armbian-install
      Update command: armbian-update
```

## 7. Downloading the System

Enter the Release section in the lower right corner of the repository homepage, select the system that corresponds to your box model. The illustration is as follows:

## 8. Installing Armbian to EMMC

Amlogic, Rockchip, and Allwinner have different installation methods. Different devices have different storage, some use an external microSD card, some have eMMC, some support the use of various storage media such as NVMe. According to the different devices, their installation methods are introduced separately. First, download the Armbian system for your device from [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases), and decompress it into .img format for standby. Depending on your device, use different installation methods in the following summary.

After the installation is completed, connect the Armbian device to the `router`, wait for the device to boot for `2 minutes`, and then check the `IP` of the device named Armbian in the router for management settings using `SSH` tool. The default username is `root`, the default password is `1234`, and the default port is `22`.

### 8.3 Allwinner Series Installation Method

Log in to the Armbian system (default user: root, default password: 1234) → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-install
```

## 9. Compiling Armbian Kernel

Kernel compilation is supported in Ubuntu20.04/22.04, Debian11 or Armbian systems. Both local compilation and GitHub Actions cloud compilation are supported. For specific methods, please refer to the [Kernel Compilation Instructions](../../compile-kernel).

### 9.1 How to Add Custom Kernel Patches

When there is a common kernel patch directory (`common-kernel-patches`) in the kernel patch directory [tools/patch](../../compile-kernel/tools/patch), or when there is a directory named `the same as the kernel source repository` (for example, [linux-5.15.y](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y)), you can use `-p true` to automatically apply the kernel patch. The naming convention for the patch directory is as follows:

```shell
~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian
    └── compile-kernel
        └── tools
            └── patch
                ├── common-kernel-patches  # Fixed directory name: stores common kernel patches for all versions
                ├── linux-5.15.y           # Named after the kernel source library: stores dedicated patches
                ├── linux-6.1.y
                ├── linux-5.10.y-rk35xx
                └── more kernel directory...
```

- When compiling the kernel locally, you can manually create the corresponding directory and add the corresponding custom kernel patches.
- When cloud compiling with GitHub Actions, you can use the `kernel_patch` parameter to specify the directory of the kernel patch in your repository, such as the usage of [compile-beta-kernel.yml](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/blob/main/.github/workflows/compile-beta-kernel.yml) in the [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) repository:

```yaml
- name: Compile the kernel
  uses: ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian@main
  with:
    build_target: kernel
    kernel_version: 5.15.1_6.1.1
    kernel_auto: true
    kernel_patch: kernel-patch/beta
    auto_patch: true
```

When using the `kernel_patch` parameter to specify a custom kernel patch, please name the patch directory according to the above convention.

### 9.2 How to Make Kernel Patches

- Obtained from repositories such as [Armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) and [OpenWrt](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt): for example, [armbian/patch/kernel](https://github.com/armbian/build/tree/main/patch/kernel/archive) and [openwrt/rockchip/patches-6.1](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/tree/main/target/linux/rockchip/patches-6.1), [lede/rockchip/patches-5.15](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede/tree/master/target/linux/rockchip/patches-5.15) etc., patches from these mainline kernel using repositories can generally be used directly.
- Obtained from commits in github.com repositories: Adding a `.patch` suffix to the corresponding `commit` address can generate the corresponding patch.

Before adding a custom kernel patch, it needs to be compared with the upstream kernel source repository [unifreq/linux-k.x.y](https://github.com/unifreq) to confirm whether this patch has been added to avoid conflicts. Kernel patches that pass the test are recommended to be submitted to the series of kernel repositories maintained by unifreq. Each small step for a person is a big step for the world. Your contribution will make our use of Armbian and OpenWrt systems in the box more stable and interesting.

## 10. Updating Armbian Kernel

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
# Run as root user (sudo -i)
# If no parameter is specified, it will be updated to the latest version.
armbian-update
```

| Optional Parameters | Default Value | Options | Description |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| -r | ophub/kernel | `<owner>/<repo>` | Set the repository to download the kernel from github.com |
| -u | Automatic | stable/flippy/dev/rk3588 | Set the suffix of the used kernel's [tags](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases) |
| -k | Latest Version | Kernel Version | Set the [Kernel Version](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/kernel_stable) |
| -c | None | Custom Domain | Set a cdn domain name for accelerating access to github.com |
| -b | yes | yes/no | Automatically backup the kernel currently in use when updating the kernel |
| -m | no | yes/no | Use the mainline u-boot |
| -s | None | None | [SOS] Use the system kernel in USB to restore eMMC |
| -h | None | None | View the usage help |

Example: `armbian-update -k 5.15.50 -u dev`

When specifying the kernel version number through the `-k` parameter, you can accurately specify the specific version number, such as: `armbian-update -k 5.15.50`, or you can specify the kernel series vaguely, such as: `armbian-update -k 5.15`, when vaguely specifying, it will automatically use the latest version of the specified series.

When updating the kernel, the currently used system kernel will be automatically backed up, stored in the `/ddbr/backup` directory, retaining the three most recently used kernel versions. If the newly installed kernel is unstable, you can restore to the backed-up kernel at any time:
```shell
# Enter the backup kernel directory, such as 5.10.125
cd /ddbr/backup/5.10.125
# Execute the kernel update command, which will automatically install the kernel in the current directory
armbian-update
```

In case of issues caused by special reasons such as incomplete updates, which result in the system being unable to boot from eMMC, you can boot any version of the Armbian system from a USB. By running the `armbian-update -s` command, you can update the system kernel in the USB to eMMC, accomplishing a rescue.

If your network access to github.com is poor and you can't update online, you can manually download the kernel, upload it to any directory of the Armbian system, and enter the kernel directory to execute `armbian-update` for local installation. If there's a complete set of kernel files in the current directory, it will use the kernel from the current directory for the update (the four kernel files needed for the update are `header-xxx.tar.gz`, `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz`. Other kernel files are not necessary and their presence does not affect the update. The system can accurately identify needed kernel files). You can freely update among the optional kernels supported by the device, such as updating from kernel 5.10.125 to kernel 5.15.50.

If your local network access to github.com is poor, you can add a CDN acceleration service like this: `armbian-update -c https://gh...xy.com/`. Please consult suitable local acceleration CDN domain. The acceleration domain can also be permanently written to the individual configuration file `/etc/ophub-release` in the `GITHUB_CDN='https://gh...xy.com/'` parameter, to avoid entering it each time.

Custom options set by `-r`/`-u`/`-c`/`-b` parameters can be permanently written into the relevant parameters in the individual configuration file `/etc/ophub-release`, to avoid entering it each time. The corresponding settings are:

```shell
# Assign values to custom parameters
-r  :  KERNEL_REPO='ophub/kernel'
-u  :  KERNEL_TAGS='stable'
-c  :  GITHUB_CDN='https://gh...xy.com/'
-b  :  KERNEL_BACKUP='yes'
```

## 11. Installing Common Software

Log in to the Armbian system → Enter the command:

```shell
armbian-software
```

Using the `armbian-software -u` command, you can update the local software center list. Based on user feedback in [Issue](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues), we gradually integrate commonly used [software](../armbian-files/common-files/usr/share/ophub/armbian-software/software-list.conf) to implement one-click installation/update/uninstallation and other quick operations. This includes `docker images`, `desktop software`, `application services`, etc. See more [instructions](armbian_software.md).

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions

Here's a compilation of some common issues you may encounter while using Armbian.

### 12.1 dtb and u-boot Correspondence Table for Each Box

The supported TV box list is located in the [/etc/model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf) configuration file in the `Armbian` system.

### 12.2 Instructions for LED Screen Display Control

Please refer to the [instructions](led_screen_display_control.md).

### 12.3 How to Restore the Original Android TV System

Typically, the original Android TV system is restored using armbian-ddbr backup and restore, or using the Amlogic flashing tool.

#### 12.3.1 Backup and Restore Using Armbian-ddbr

We recommend that before you install the Armbian system on a brand new box, you first backup the original Android TV system that came with the box. This is in case you need to restore the system later. Boot the Armbian system from `TF/SD/USB`, input the `armbian-ddbr` command, and then enter `b` when prompted to back up the system. The backup file is stored in `/ddbr/BACKUP-arm-64-emmc.img.gz`, please download and save it. To restore the Android TV system, upload the backup file to the same path on the `TF/SD/USB` device, enter the `armbian-ddbr` command, and then enter `r` when prompted to restore the system.


#### 12.3.2 Recovering using Amlogic Flashing Tool

- Generally, if you can boot from USB by reinserting the power supply, you can just reinstall. Try it multiple times if necessary.

- If the screen is black after connecting to a monitor and you can't boot from USB, you'll need to short-circuit initialize the box. First, restore the box to the original Android system, and then reinstall the Armbian system. Download the [amlogic_usb_burning_tool](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools) recovery tool and install it. Prepare a [USB double male data cable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/159267576-74ad69a5-b6fc-489d-b1a6-0f8f8ff28634.png) and a [paperclip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/159267790-38cf4681-6827-4cb6-86b2-19c7f1943342.png).

- Taking x96max+ as an example, confirm the location of the [short-circuit point](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/110590933-67785300-81b3-11eb-9860-986ef35dca7d.jpg) on the box's motherboard, and download the box's [Android TV system package](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools). Android TV systems and corresponding short-circuit point diagrams for other common devices can also be [downloaded and viewed here](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools).

```shell
Operating method:

1. Open USB Burning Tool:
   [ File → Import image ]: X96Max_Plus2_20191213-1457_ATV9_davietPDA_v1.5.img
   [ Select ]：Erase Flash
   [ Select ]：Erase bootloader
   Click on the [ Start ] button
2. Use the [ paperclip ] to short-circuit the [ two short-circuit points ] on the box's motherboard,
   and at the same time use the [ USB double male data cable ] to connect the [ box ] with the [ computer ].
3. When you see the [ progress bar starts moving ], remove the paperclip, no longer short-circuit.
4. When you see [ progress bar at 100% ], the flashing is complete, the box has been restored to the Android TV system.
   Click on the [ Stop ] button, unplug the [ USB double male data cable ] between the [ box ] and [ computer ].
5. If any of the above steps fail, try again until successful.
   If the progress bar does not move, you can try plugging in the power supply. Normally, you don't need power support for flashing, only the power supply from the USB double male can meet the requirements.
```

Once you've finished restoring factory settings, the box has been restored to the Android TV system, and the other steps to install the Armbian system are the same as when you first installed the system, just repeat them.

### 12.4 Setting the box to boot from USB/TF/SD

- Insert the USB/TF/SD with the installed system into the box.
- Enable developer mode: Settings → About device → Version number (e.g., X96max plus...), rapidly click the left mouse button 5 times on the version number, until the system shows the prompt `You are now a developer`.
- Enable USB debugging: System → Advanced options → Developer options (set `USB debugging` to enabled). Enable `ADB` debugging.
- Install ADB tool: Download [adb](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools) and extract it, copy the three files `adb.exe`, `AdbWinApi.dll`, `AdbWinUsbApi.dll` to the `system32` and `syswow64` folders under `c://windows/`, then open the `cmd` command panel, use the `adb --version` command, if it shows, it means it can be used.
- Enter `cmd` command mode. Enter the `adb connect 192.168.1.137` command (modify the IP according to your box, you can check it in the router device that the box is connected to), if the connection is successful, it will display `connected to 192.168.1.137:5555`
- Enter the `adb shell reboot update` command, the box will reboot and boot from your inserted USB/TF/SD, you can enter the system by accessing the system's IP address from the browser, or via SSH.

### 12.5 Disable Infrared Receiver

By default, support for the infrared receiver is enabled, but if you are using your TV box as a server, you might want to disable the IR kernel module to prevent it from mistakenly turning off your box. To completely disable IR, add the following line:

```shell
blacklist meson_ir
```

to `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` and restart.

### 12.6 Boot file selection

- Currently known devices, only `T95(s905x)` / `T95Z-Plus(s912)` / `BesTV-R3300L(s905l-b)` and a few other devices need to use the `/bootfs/extlinux/extlinux.conf` file, which has been added by default in the system. If other devices need it, you can write the system into USB, double-click to open the `boot` partition, and delete the `.bak` in the system's built-in `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf.bak` file name to use. When writing to eMMC, `armbian-install` will automatically check. If the `extlinux.conf` file exists, it will be created automatically.

- Other devices only need `/boot/uEnv.txt` to boot, do not modify the `extlinux.conf.bak` file.

### 12.7 Network Configuration

#### 12.7.1 Network Configuration Using Interfaces 

The default content of the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` is as follows:

```shell
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
# Network is managed by Network manager
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```

##### 12.7.1.1 IP Address Assignment via DHCP

```shell
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

##### 12.7.1.2 Manual Setup of Static IP Address

Modify the IP, gateway, and DNS according to your network condition.

```shell
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
hwaddress ether 12:34:56:78:9A:DA
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
```

##### 12.7.1.3 Establish Interconnected Network Using OpenWrt in Docker 

Modify the MAC address according to your needs.

```shell
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

allow-hotplug eth0
no-auto-down eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

auto macvlan
iface macvlan inet dhcp
        pre-up ip link add macvlan link eth0 type macvlan mode bridge
        post-down ip link del macvlan link eth0 type macvlan mode bridge

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```

#### 12.7.2 Network Management Using NetworkManager

##### 12.7.2.1 Create a New Network Connection

Preparation work before creating or modifying a network connection.

###### 12.7.2.1.1 Get Network Interface Name

Check which network interfaces are available for establishing network connections.

```shell
nmcli device | grep -E "^[e].*|^[w].*|^[D].*|^[T].*" | awk '{printf "%-19s%-19s\n",$1,$2}'
```

The `DEVICE` column displays the network interface name, and the `TYPE` column displays the network interface type.

Where `eth0` = the name of the first Ethernet card, `eth1` = the name of the second Ethernet card, and so on. The same goes for wireless cards.

```shell
DEVICE             TYPE
eth0               ethernet
eth1               ethernet
eth2               ethernet
eth3               ethernet
wlan0              wifi
wlan1              wifi
```

###### 12.7.2.1.2 Get Existing Network Connection Name

Check existing network connections on the device, including used and unused connections. When creating a new network connection, it is recommended not to use existing connection names.

```shell
nmcli connection show | grep -E ".*|^[N].*" | awk '{printf "%-19s%-19s\n", $1,$3}'
```

The `NAME` column displays the name of the existing network connection, and the `TYPE` column displays the network interface type.

Where `ethernet` = Ethernet card, `wifi` = wireless card, `bridge` = bridge

```shell
NAME               TYPE
cnc                ethernet
lan                ethernet
lte                ethernet
tel                ethernet
docker0            bridge
titanium           wifi
cpe                wifi
```

###### 12.7.2.1.3 Create a Wired Network Connection

Create a new network connection on network interface `eth0` and make it effective immediately (`Dynamic IP Address` - `IPv4 / IPv6`).

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ether1                  # New network connection name
MYETH=eth0                    # Network interface name = eth0 / eth1 / eht2 / eth3
IPV6AGM=stable-privacy        # IPv6 address status mode = stable-privacy / eui64

# Add ETH
nmcli connection add \
con-name $MYCON \
type ethernet \
ifname $MYETH \
autoconnect yes \
ipv6.addr-gen-mode $IPV6AGM
nmcli connection up $MYCON
ip -c -br address
```

Create a new network connection on network interface `eth0` and make it effective immediately (`Static IP Address` - `IPv4`).

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ether1                  # Network connection name
MYETH=eth0                    # Network interface name = eth0 / eth1 / eht2 / eth3
IP=192.168.67.167/24          # HOST IP address, where 24 is the subnet mask corresponding to 255.255.255.0
GW=192.168.67.1               # Gateway
DNS=119.29.29.29,223.5.5.5    # DNS server address

# Chg CON

ip -c -br address
```

###### 12.7.2.1.4 Creating a Wireless Network Connection

Create a network connection on the `wlan0` network interface and take effect immediately (`Dynamic IP address` - `IPv4 / IPv6`).

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ssid                    # Name of the new network connection, it is recommended to use WiFi SSID to specify the connection name
MYSSID=ssid                   # WiFi SSID, case sensitive
MYPSWD=passwd                 # WiFi password

wifi-sec.psk $MYPSWD
nmcli connection up $MYCON
ip -c -br address
```

##### 12.7.2.3 Modify Network Address Allocation Method

###### 12.7.2.3.1 Static IP address - IPv4

Modify the IP address allocation method to `Static IP address` on the network connection `ether1` and take effect immediately.

*Applicable to wired connections / wireless connections

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ether1                  # Network connection name
IP=192.168.67.167/24          # HOST IP address, where 24 is the subnet mask corresponding to 255.255.255.0
GW=192.168.67.1               # Gateway
DNS=119.29.29.29,223.5.5.5    # DNS server address

# Chg CON
nmcli connection modify $MYCON \
ipv4.method manual \
ipv4.addresses $IP \
ipv4.gateway $GW \
ipv4.dns $DNS
nmcli connection up $MYCON
ip -c -br address
```

###### 12.7.2.3.2 DHCP Obtains Dynamic IP Address - IPv4 / IPv6

Modify the IP address allocation method to `DHCP Obtains Dynamic IP Address` on the network connection `ether1` and take effect immediately.

*Applicable to wired connections / wireless connections

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ether1                  # Network connection name

# Chg CON
nmcli connection modify $MYCON \
ipv4.method auto \
ipv6.method auto
nmcli connection up $MYCON
ip -c -br address
```

##### 12.7.2.4 Modify Network Connection MAC Address

Modify (clone) the `MAC Address` on the network connection `ether1` and take effect immediately to solve the problem of LAN MAC address conflict.

*Applicable to wired connections / wireless connections

```shell
# Set ENV
MYCON=ether1                  # Network connection name, note to match the network interface type
MYTYPE=ethernet               # Network interface type = Wired network card / Wireless network card = ethernet / wifi
MYMAC=12:34:56:78:9A:BC       # New MAC address

# Chg CON
nmcli connection modify ${MYCON} \
${MYTYPE}.cloned-mac-address ${MYMAC}
nmcli connection up ${MYETH}
ip -c -br address
```

* When creating or modifying some network parameters, the network connection may be disconnected and reconnected to the network.
* Due to different software and hardware environments (box, system, network equipment, etc.), it takes about `1-15` seconds to take effect. If it does not take effect for a longer time, it is recommended to check the software and hardware environment.

##### 12.7.2.5 How to Disable IPv6

You can use the `nmcli` utility to disable the `IPv6` protocol from the command line. Please refer to [disable-ipv6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/zh-cn/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/using-networkmanager-to-disable-ipv6-for-a-specific-connection_configuring-and-managing-networking) for the source.

Step 1, use the `nmcli connection show` command to view the network connection list, and the returned result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                 UUID                                   TYPE       DEVICE
Wired connection 1   8a7e0151-9c66-4e6f-89ee-65bb2d64d366   ethernet   eth0
...
```

Step 2, set the ipv6.method parameter of the connection to disabled:

```shell
nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv6.method "disabled"
```

Step 3, reconnect to the network:

```shell
nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
```

Step 4, check the network connection status. If there is no inet6 entry displayed, IPv6 is disabled on the device:

```shell
ip address show eth0
```

Step 5, verify whether the `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/disable_ipv6` file now contains the value `1`

```shell
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/disable_ipv6
1
```

#### 12.7.3 How to Enable Wireless

Some devices support using wireless, the enablement method is as follows:

```shell
# Install management tool
sudo apt-get install network-manager

# Check network devices
sudo nmcli dev

# Enable wireless
sudo nmcli r wifi on

# Scan wireless
sudo nmcli dev wifi

# Connect to wireless
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "wifi name" password "wifi password"

# Display the saved network connection list
sudo nmcli connection show

# Disconnect
sudo nmcli connection down "wifi name"

# Forget the connection and cancel automatic connection
sudo nmcli connection delete "wifi name"
```

#### 12.7.4 How to Enable Bluetooth

Some devices support using Bluetooth, the enablement method is as follows:

```shell
# Install Bluetooth support
armbian-config >> Network >> BT: Install Bluetooth support

# Reboot the system
reboot
```

After the system reboots, check whether the Bluetooth driver is normal. The desktop system can connect Bluetooth devices from the menu. It can also be installed using the terminal graphical interface.

```shell
dmesg | grep Bluetooth
```

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">

# If not started, start the Bluetooth service first
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth

# Scan nearby Bluetooth devices
bluetoothctl scan on

# Enable Bluetooth discovery
bluetoothctl discoverable on

# Pair the Bluetooth MAC address
bluetoothctl pair 12:34:56:78:90:AB

# Check the paired Bluetooth devices
blluetoothctl paired-devices

# Connect to the Bluetooth device
bluetoothctl connect 12:34:56:78:90:AB

# Trust the device for easy connection next time
bluetoothctl trust 12:34:56:78:90:AB

# Disconnect the Bluetooth device
bluetoothctl disconnect 12:34:56:78:90:AB

# Unpair the Bluetooth device
bluetoothctl remove 12:34:56:78:90:AB

# Block the connected device
bluetoothctl block 12:34:56:78:90:AB
```

### 12.8 How to Add Startup Tasks

A custom script for startup tasks has already been added to the system. In the Armbian system, the path is [/etc/custom_service/start_service.sh](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/custom_service/start_service.sh). You can customize and add related tasks to this script according to your personal needs.

### 12.9 How to Update Service Scripts in the System

By using the `armbian-sync` command, you can update all service scripts in the local system to the latest version with one click.

### 12.10 How to Get Android System Partition Information on eMMC

When we write the Armbian system into the eMMC system, we need to first confirm the Android system partition table of the device to ensure that data is written to a safe area. Try not to damage the Android system partition table to avoid problems such as the system not being able to start. If you write to an unsafe area, it may fail to start or display an error similar to the one below:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187075834-4ac40263-52ae-4538-a4b1-d6f0d5b9c856.png">
</div>

#### 12.10.1 Obtaining Partition Information

If you are using Armbian released in this repository after 2022.11, you can copy and paste the following command to obtain a URL that records the complete partition information (the device itself does not need to be connected to the internet):

```shell
ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode webreport 2>/dev/null
```

*The webreport mode of ampart was introduced in the v1.2 version released on 2023.02.03. If there is no output when you use the above command, it may be an older version that does not support directly outputting URLs. You can instead use the following command:*

```shell
echo "https://7ji.github.io/ampart-web-reporter/?dsnapshot=$(ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode dsnapshot 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)&esnapshot=$(ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode esnapshot 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)"
```

The URL you obtain will look similar to the one below:

```shell
https://7ji.github.io/ampart-web-reporter/?esnapshot=bootloader:0:4194304:0%20reserved:37748736:67108864:0%20cache:113246208:754974720:2%20env:876609536:8388608:0%20logo:893386752:33554432:1%20recovery:935329792:33554432:1%20rsv:977272832:8388608:1%20tee:994050048:8388608:1%20crypt:1010827264:33554432:1%20misc:1052770304:33554432:1%20instaboot:1094713344:536870912:1%20boot:1639972864:33554432:1%20system:1681915904:1073741824:1%20params:2764046336:67108864:2%20bootfiles:2839543808:754974720:2%20data:3602907136:4131389440:4&dsnapshot=logo::33554432:1%20recovery::33554432:1%20rsv::8388608:1%20tee::8388608:1%20crypt::33554432:1%20misc::33554432:1%20instaboot::536870912:1%20boot::33554432:1%20system::1073741824:1%20cache::536870912:2%20params::67108864:2%20data::-1:4

</div>

#### 12.10.2 Sharing Partition Information

When you need to share partition information with others (for example, posting to this repository to report on a new device, or seeking help from others), try to share the URL itself rather than a screenshot. If you mind the URL being too long, you can use some free short URL tools.

- On the one hand, the partition information on the webpage is dynamically generated each time you visit. The annotation of whether certain partitions can be written to and the format of the table may be updated.
- On the other hand, others cannot conveniently copy partition parameters from screenshots for calculations, etc.

Also, you don't need to manually organize parameters into a table file. The layout of the table on the webpage has been specifically designed to be easily copied and pasted into Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

#### 12.10.3 Interpreting Partition Information

The DTB table records the partition layout that every box's **system** hopes for in Android DTB. This layout usually ends with a `data` partition of automatically filled size, so boxes of the same system (and therefore, the same model) will necessarily have the same layout here. The actual partition layout on the box may vary due to different eMMC capacities, but it is always determined by the DTB partition layout (i.e., given the DTB partition layout and the exact size of eMMC, the eMMC partition situation can be deduced. *Did you notice that the above DTB partition information and eMMC partition information do not come from the same box?*).

The eMMC table is the actual eMMC partition layout on the box. Each row represents a storage area, which could be a partition or a gap between partitions (due to Amlogic's quirky decision, there is at least an 8M gap between each partition, which was intended to be used for other purposes, but hasn't been used even in the latest S905X4, wasting space). In the row corresponding to a partition, the font is black, and both the offset and mask columns have values. In the row corresponding to a gap, the font is grey, the offset and mask columns have no values, and the partition name is `gap`.

In the eMMC table, the last column of each storage area indicates whether it can be written to. Green and `yes` mean the area can be written to, red and `no` mean the area absolutely cannot be written to, and yellow with a label indicates it can be written to under certain prerequisites, or only part of it can be written to.

Using the above table as an example, the `0+4M` (`0M~4M`) area corresponding to the `bootloader` partition absolutely cannot be written to, the `32M` gap (`4M~36M`) after it can be written to, the `36M+64M` (`36M~100M`) area corresponding to the `reserved` partition absolutely cannot be written to, the gap from there to the gap before `env` (`100M~836M`) can all be written to, the 1M after `env` (`837M to the end`) can be written to in case the Android boot logo is not needed, then the writable range on eMMC is:

- 4M~36M
- 100M~836M
- 837M~end

If the Android boot logo is needed, additionally, the 852M + 32M (`852M~884M`) area corresponding to the `logo` partition cannot be written to, then the writable range on eMMC is:

- 4M~36M
- 100M~836M
- 837M~852M
- 884M~end


#### 12.10.4 For eMMC Installation

If your device fails when using `armbian-install` and the `-a` parameter (use [ampart](https://github.com/7Ji/ampart) to adjust the eMMC partition layout) is `yes` (default value), then your box cannot use the optimal layout (that is, adjust the DTB partition information to only have `data`, then generate eMMC partition information from this, and then move all remaining partitions forward. In this way, the space from 117M onwards can be used). You need to modify the corresponding partition information in [armbian-install](../armbian-files/common-files/usr/sbin/armbian-install).

In this file, the key parameters for declaring the partition layout are three: `BLANK1`, `BOOT`, `BLANK2`. Among them, `BLANK1` represents the unusable size starting from the beginning of eMMC; `BOOT` represents the size of the partition created after `BLANK1` for storing the kernel, DTB, etc., preferably not less than 256M, `BLANK2` represents the unusable size after `BOOT`. The space after this will be used to create the `ROOT` partition to store all the data outside the `/boot` mount point in the system. All three should be integers, and the unit is MiB (1 MiB = 1024 KiB = 1024^2 Byte)

In the case discussed in the previous paragraph where the `logo` partition is not needed, we naturally hope to use all the usable space, but the area of `4M~36M` is too small to be used as `BOOT`, so it can only be counted in the unusable `BLANK1`. The area of `100M~836M` is more than enough to be used as `BOOT`, so this 736M can be allocated to `BOOT` entirely. After this, there is an unusable area of `836M~837M`, which is given to `BLANK2`, so the parameters to be used should be as follows (only `s905x3` is used as an example in the following text, if your SoC is other, you need to modify other corresponding code blocks):

```shell
# Set partition size (Unit: MiB)
elif [[ "${AMLOGIC_SOC}" == "s905x3" ]]; then
    BLANK1="100"
    BOOT="736"
    BLANK2="1"
```

### 12.11 How to Create a u-boot File

The u-boot file is an important file for the system to boot normally.

#### 12.11.1 Extracting the bootloader and dtb files

Extraction requires the HxD software. You can get the installation from the [official download link](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) or the [backup download link](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/download/tools/HxDSetup.2.5.0.0.zip).

Execute the following commands one by one in the `cmd` panel to extract the relevant files and download them to your local computer.

```shell
# Use adb tool to enter the box
adb connect 192.168.1.111
adb shell

# Export bootloader command
dd if=/dev/block/bootloader of=/data/local/bootloader.bin

# Export dtb command
cat /dev/dtb >/data/local/mybox.dtb

# Export gpio command
cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio >/data/local/mybox_gpio.txt

# Download the bootloader, dtb, and gpio files to the root directory of the C drive on your local computer in the mybox folder
adb pull /data/local/bootloader.bin C:\mybox
adb pull /data/local/mybox.dtb C:\mybox
adb pull /data/local/mybox_gpio.txt C:\mybox
```

#### 12.11.2 Creating acs.bin file

The most important part of the mainline u-boot is the acs.bin, which is used to initialize part of the memory. The original factory u-boot is located at the very front of the system, at a 4MB position. Use the `bootloader.bin` file obtained just now to extract the `acs.bin` file.

Open the HxD software, open the exported `bootloader.bin` file, `Right click - Select range`, start position `F200`, length `1000`, select `hexadecimal`.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056711-1b58ce71-2a7d-4e9b-a976-e5f278edaa53.png">

Copy the selected result, then create a new file, paste in insert mode, ignore the warning, and save it as the acs.bin file.

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056725-0a0e60af-6a21-4a6b-a2d5-f3d46b438a6a.png">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056827-8419c738-3428-473e-9a95-ab7270170d98.png">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056852-9f62f16a-f7f1-4c34-a2c2-78358d198f9a.png">
</div>

If the bootloader is locked, the code in this area is garbled and useless. Normally, there should be many `0`s as in the picture above, `cfg` will appear several times in succession, and `ddr` related words will appear in the middle. This normal code can be used.

#### 12.11.3 Creating u-boot Files

Creating u-boot requires source repositories https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip and https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot to compile two u-boot files for your device.

Within the amlogic-boot-fip source code, the only file that varies by device model is acs.bin, all other files are universal.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187057209-c4716384-46ef-4922-9710-8da7ae6db1e4.png">

For instructions on creating u-boot, see the specific instructions in https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/doc/board/amlogic, and choose your device model for compiling and testing.

Creating u-boot according to [unifreq](https://github.com/unifreq)'s method requires the use of the device's acs.bin, dts, and config files. The dts exported from the Android system cannot be directly converted into the Armbian format, so you need to write a corresponding dts file yourself. Based on the specific differences in hardware on your device, such as switches, LEDs, power control, TF card, SDIO wifi module, etc., modify and create a [dts](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y/tree/main/arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic) file from the similar ones in the kernel source repository.

For example, creating a u-boot for X96Max Plus:

```shell
~/make-uboot

```

- Download the [amlogic-boot-fip](https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip) source code. In the root directory, create a [x96max-plus](https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip/tree/master/x96max-plus) directory. Other than the `asc.bin` file that you created, all other files can be copied from other directories.
- Download the [u-boot](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot) source code. Create a corresponding [x96max-plus_defconfig](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/configs/x96max-plus_defconfig) file and put it into the [configs](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/configs) directory. Create the corresponding [meson-sm1-x96-max-plus-u-boot.dtsi](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/meson-sm1-x96-max-plus-u-boot.dtsi) and [meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dts](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dts) files and put them in the [arch/arm/dts](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/arch/arm/dts) directory, then edit the [Makefile](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/Makefile) in this directory to add the `meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dtb` file index.
- In the root directory of the u-boot source code, follow the steps in the document https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/doc/board/amlogic/x96max-plus.rst.

Two types of files are ultimately generated: the `u-boot.bin` file in the u-boot root directory is an incomplete version of u-boot used in the `/boot` directory (corresponds to the [overload](../amlogic-u-boot/overload) directory in the repository); the `u-boot.bin` and `u-boot.bin.sd.bin` in the `fip` directory are complete versions of u-boot files used in the `/usr/lib/u-boot/` directory (corresponds to the [bootloader](../amlogic-u-boot/bootloader/) directory in the repository). The complete versions of the two files differ by 512 bytes, the larger one has 512 bytes of 0 filled in front.

💡 Tip: Before writing to eMMC for testing, please refer to section 12.3 for unbricking methods. Be sure to understand the short circuit point location, have the original .img format Android system file, and have performed short-circuit flashing tests. Ensure that you have mastered all the unbricking methods before proceeding with writing tests.

### 12.12 Error in Memory Size Recognition

If the memory size is recognized incorrectly (it is abnormal for 4G memory to be recognized as 1-2G, and it is normal to be recognized as 3.7G), you can try to manually copy a `/boot/UBOOT_OVERLOAD` file (please note it's "copy", "do not rename", as renaming it will make the system unable to boot after installation and updates). When used in `USB`, save it as `/boot/u-boot.ext`, and when used in `eMMC`, save it as `/boot/u-boot.emmc`.

Apart from trying to solve memory problems, do not manually copy the u-boot file. Incorrect addition will cause the system to fail to boot and various problems to occur.

### 12.13 How to Decompile dtb Files

Some new devices are not currently supported (or have variants), and you can try to adjust related parameters by decompiling.

```shell
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y device-tree-compiler

# 1. Decompilation command (generate dts source code using dtb file)
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o xxx.dts xxx.dtb

# 2. Compilation command (generate dtb file using dts)
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o xxx.dtb xxx.dts
```

### 12.14 How to Modify cmdline Settings

In Amlogic devices, you can add/modify/delete settings in the `/boot/uEnv.txt` file. In Rockchip and Allwinner devices, you can set in the `/boot/armbianEnv.txt` file (add to `extraargs` or `extraboardargs` parameters). Devices using `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` configure in this file. You need to restart after each change for it to take effect.

- For instance, the `Home Assistant Supervisor` application only supports the `docker cgroup v1` version, while the currently default installed version for Docker is the latest v2. If you need to switch to the v1 version, you can add the `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` parameter setting in cmdline. After restarting, you can switch to the `docker cgroup v1` version.

- By adding `max_loop=128` in cmdline, you can adjust the allowable amount of loop mounts.

- By adding `usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1024` in cmdline, you can permanently change the USBFS memory buffer from the default `16 mb` to larger (`cat /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb`), improving the ability to transfer large files over USB.

- By adding `usbcore.usb3_disable=1` in cmdline, you can disable all USB 3.0 devices.

### 12.15 How to Add New Supported Devices

To build an Armbian system for a device, you need to use the `device configuration file`, `system file`, `u-boot file`, and `process control file`. The specific addition methods are introduced as follows:

#### 12.15.1 Add Device Configuration File

In the configuration file [/etc/model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf), add the corresponding configuration information according to the device's test support status. The `BUILD` value is `yes` for some default build devices, the corresponding `BOARD` value `must be unique`, these boxes can use the default built Armbian system directly.

The default value is `no` without packaging, these devices need to download the same `FAMILY` Armbian system when using, after writing to `USB`, you can open `USB's boot partition` on your computer, modify the `FDT dtb name` in `/boot/uEnv.txt` file, adapt to other devices in the list.

#### 12.15.2 Add System Files

Common files are placed in the `build-armbian/armbian-files/common-files` directory, universally applicable across platforms.

Platform files are respectively placed in `build-armbian/armbian-files/platform-files/<platform>` directory, [Amlogic](../armbian-files/platform-files/amlogic), [Rockchip](../armbian-files/platform-files/rockchip), and [Allwinner](../armbian-files/platform-files/allwinner) share files of their respective platforms. The `bootfs` directory contains /boot partition files, and the `rootfs` directory contains Armbian system files.

If individual devices have special differential setting requirements, add an independent directory named after `BOARD` in the `build-armbian/armbian-files/different-files` directory, create `bootfs` directory as needed to add related files under system `/boot` partition, create `rootfs` directory as needed to add system files. All folder names are based on the actual path in the `Armbian` system. Used to add new files, or to override the same name files added from the common files and platform files.

#### 12.15.3 Add u-boot Files

`Amlogic` series devices, share [bootloader](../u-boot/amlogic/bootloader/) files and [u-boot](../u-boot/amlogic/overload) files. If there are new files, put them in the corresponding directory. The `bootloader` files will automatically be added to the Armbian system's `/usr/lib/u-boot` directory during system construction, and `u-boot` files will be automatically added to the `/boot` directory.

`Rockchip` and `Allwinner` series devices, add an independent [u-boot](../u-boot) file directory named after `BOARD` for each device, and the corresponding series files are placed in this directory.

During the Armbian image construction, these u-boot files will be written into the corresponding Armbian image files by the rebuild script according to the configuration in [/etc/model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf).

#### 12.15.4 Add Process Control Files

Add the corresponding `BOARD` option to `armbian_board` in the [yml workflow control file](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml), which supports use in `Actions` on github.com.

### 12.16 How to Resolve the Issue of I/O Errors While Writing to eMMC

Some devices can normally boot Armbian from USB/SD/TF, but when writing to eMMC, an I/O write error is reported, such as the case in [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues/989), with the following error message:

```shell
[  284.338449] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.341544] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
[  284.446972] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.450074] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
[  284.497746] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.500871] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
```

In such a situation, you can adjust the working mode speed and frequency of the dtb being used to stabilize the read and write support for storage. When using sdr mode, the frequency is twice the speed. When using ddr mode, the frequency equals the speed. For example:

```shell
sd-uhs-sdr12
sd-uhs-sdr25
sd-uhs-sdr50
sd-uhs-ddr50
sd-uhs-sdr104

max-frequency = <208000000>;
```

Take the code snippet in the [dts](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y/tree/main/arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic) file of the kernel source code as an example:

```shell
/* SD card */
&sd_emmc_b {
	status = "okay";

	bus-width = <4>;
	cap-sd-highspeed;
	sd-uhs-sdr12;
	sd-uhs-sdr25;
	sd-uhs-sdr50;
	max-frequency = <100000000>;
};

/* eMMC */
&sd_emmc_c {
	status = "okay";

	bus-width = <8>;
	cap-mmc-highspeed;
	max-frequency = <100000000>;
};
```

Generally, reducing the frequency of `&sd_emmc_c` from `max-frequency = <200000000>;` to `max-frequency = <100000000>;` can solve the problem. If it doesn't work, you can continue to reduce it to `50000000` for testing, and adjust `&sd_emmc_b` to set `USB/SD/TF`, you can also use `sd-uhs-sdr` to limit speed. You can modify the dts file and [compile](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/compile-kernel) to get the test file, or you can use the method introduced in `Section 12.13` to decompile and modify the existing dtb file to generate the test file. When modifying the decompiled dtb file, use hexadecimal values, where the decimal `200000000` corresponds to the hexadecimal `0xbebc200`, the decimal `100000000` corresponds to the hexadecimal `0x5f5e100`, the decimal `50000000` corresponds to the hexadecimal `0x2faf080`, and the decimal `25000000` corresponds to the hexadecimal `0x17d7840`.

In addition to solving this issue through the system software layer, it can also be resolved through [money ability](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues/998) and [hands-on ability](https://www.right.com.cn/forum/thread-901586-1-1.html).

### 12.17 How to Solve the Issue of No Sound in the Bullseye Version

Error log information for the sound issue:

```shell
Mar 29 15:47:18 armbian-ct2000 kernel:  fe.dai-link-0: ASoC: dpcm_fe_dai_prepare() failed (-22)
Mar 29 15:47:18 armbian-ct2000 kernel:  fe.dai-link-0: ASoC: no backend DAIs enabled for fe.dai-link-0
```

Please refer to the method in [Bullseye NO Sound](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues/1000) for settings.

```shell
wget https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/download/tools/bullseye_g12_sound-khadas-utils-4-2-any.tar.gz
tar -xzf bullseye_g12_sound-khadas-utils-4-2-any.tar.gz -C /

systemctl enable sound.service
systemctl restart sound.service
```

Restart Armbian for testing. If the sound still doesn't work, it may be because your box is using the old conf corresponding to the sound output route. You need to comment out the new configuration corresponding to `L137-L142` in /usr/bin/g12_sound.sh (mainly for G12B, that is, S922X, before the old G12A/S905X2, and most of the SM1/S905X3 based on G12A can't be used), and then uncomment the old configuration corresponding to `L130-L134`.
