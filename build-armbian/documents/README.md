# How to build and use Armbian

View Chinese description  |  [查看中文说明](README.cn.md)

`GitHub Actions` is a service launched by `Microsoft`. It provides a virtual server environment with very good performance configuration. Based on it, projects can be built, tested, packaged, and deployed. The public repository can be used for free without time limit, and the single compilation time is up to `6 hours`, which is enough for compiling  `Armbian` (we can usually complete a compilation in about `3 hours`). Sharing is only for the exchange of experience. Please understand the deficiencies. Please do not initiate various bad attacks on the Internet, and do not maliciously use it.

## 4. Personalized Armbian firmware customization file description

The firmware compilation process is controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. There are other `yml files` in the `workflows` directory to achieve other different functions. When compiling the firmware, the Armbian official current code is used for real-time compilation, and the relevant parameters can be found in the official documentation.

```yaml
- name: Compile Armbian [ ${{ env.ARMBIAN_BOARD }} ]
  id: compile
  run: |
    cd build/
    ./compile.sh RELEASE=${{ env.ARMBIAN_RELEASE }} BOARD=odroidn2 BRANCH=current BUILD_ONLY=default HOST=armbian EXPERT=yes \
        BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no CLEAN_LEVEL="make,cache,alldebs,sources" COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE="sha"
    echo "build_tag=Armbian_${{ env.ARMBIAN_RELEASE }}_$(date +"%m.%d.%H%M")" >> ${GITHUB_OUTPUT}
    echo "status=success" >> ${GITHUB_OUTPUT}
```

## 5. Compile the firmware

There are many ways to compile firmware, you can set timed compilation, manual compilation, or set some specific events to trigger compilation. Let's start with simple operations.

### 5.1 Manual compilation

In the `navigation bar of your repository`, click the `Actions` button, and then click `Build armbian` > `Run workflow` > `Run workflow` to start the compilation, wait about `3 hours`, and complete the compilation after all the processes are over. The icons are as follows:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163203938-e7762b09-e6b8-4cf5-b1f1-9c67c1a29953.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204044-9c7a7429-47ee-4fce-b7dd-e217bebf6133.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204127-6b16b558-7e78-4c22-a28a-7b37b5a34fa3.png width="300" />
</div>

### 5.2 Compile at the agreed time

In the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file, use `cron` to set the timing compilation. The 5 different positions represent min (0 - 59) / hour (0 - 23) / day of month (1 - 31) / month (1 - 12) / day of week (0 - 6)(Sunday - Saturday). Set the time by modifying the values of different positions. The system uses `UTC standard time` by default, please convert it according to the time zone of your country.

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 17 * * *'
```

### 5.3 Customize the default firmware configuration

The configuration information of the default firmware is recorded in the [model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf) file, the `BUILD` value of the firmware to be compiled is set to `yes`, and the `BOARD` name must be unique.

It is specified by the `-b` parameter when compiling `locally`, and specified by the `armbian_board` parameter when compiling in `Actions` of github.com.

In general, you only need to compile the general firmware. Other boxes in the same family can refer to the configuration file information table and use it by modifying the `dtb` value in `/boot/uEnv.txt`.

## 6. Save the firmware

The settings saved by the firmware are also controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. We will automatically upload the compiled firmware to the `Releases` officially provided by `GitHub` through scripts.

```yaml
- name: Upload Armbian image to Release
  uses: ncipollo/release-action@main
  if: ${{ env.PACKAGED_STATUS }} == 'success' && !cancelled()
  with:
    tag: Armbian_${{ env.ARMBIAN_RELEASE }}_${{ env.PACKAGED_OUTPUTDATE }}
    artifacts: ${{ env.PACKAGED_OUTPUTPATH }}/*
    allowUpdates: true
    token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    body: |
      These are the Armbian OS image
      * OS information
      Default username: root
      Default password: 1234
      Install command: armbian-install
      Update command: armbian-update
```

## 7. Download the firmware

Enter from the GitHub `Releases` section at the bottom right corner of the `Repository homepage`, and select the firmware corresponding to the model of your `Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes`. The icons are as follows:

#### 8.2.4 Installation method of BeikeYun

Method reproduced from milton's [tutorial](https://www.cnblogs.com/milton/p/15391525.html). Flashing needs to enter Maskrom mode. Disconnect all connections first, short the two contacts of CLK and GND (use the GND of TTL, or the GND of the small button next to it), and then connect the USB to the PC to detect the MASKROM device. The position of the short-circuit point is as follows:

### 8.3 Allwinner Series Installation Method

Login in to armbian (default user: root, default password: 1234) → input command:

```yaml
armbian-install
```

## 9. Compile the Armbian kernel

Supports compiling the kernel in Ubuntu20.04/22.04 or Armbian system. It supports local compilation and cloud compilation using GitHub Actions. For details, see [Kernel Compilation Instructions](../../compile-kernel).

## 10. Update Armbian Kernel

Login in to armbian → input command:

```yaml
# Run as root user (sudo -i)
# If no other parameters are specified, the following update command will update to the latest version of the current kernel of the same series.
armbian-update
```

| Optional  | Default     | Value       | Description                   |
| -------   | -------     | ----------  | ---------------------------   |
| -k        | latest      | [kernel name](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable)  | Set the kernel name |
| -v        | stable      | stable/rk3588/dev  | Set the kernel version branch |
| -m        | no          | yes/no      | Use Mainline u-boot           |
| -b        | yes         | yes/no      | Automatically backup the current system kernel  |
| -r        | ""          | ""          | [Rescue] Update eMMC with system kernel from USB |

Example: `armbian-update -k 5.15.50 -v dev`

When updating the kernel, the kernel used by the current system will be automatically backed up. The storage path is in the `/ddbr/backup` directory, and the three recently used versions of the kernel will be preserved. If the newly installed kernel is unstable, the backed up kernel can be restored at any time:
```shell
# Enter the backup kernel directory, such as 5.10.125
cd /ddbr/backup/5.10.125
# Executing the update kernel command will automatically install the kernel in the current directory
armbian-update
```

When the system cannot be started from eMMC due to incomplete updates and other problems caused by special reasons, you can start any kernel version of the Armian system from USB, and run the `armbian-update -r` command to update the system kernel in USB to eMMC to achieve the purpose of rescue.

If the network where you access github.com is blocked and you cannot download updates online, you can manually download the kernel, upload it to any directory on the Armbian system, enter the kernel directory, and execute `armbian-update` for local installation. If there is a set of kernel files in the current directory, it will be updated with the kernel in the current directory (The 4 kernel files required for the update are `header-xxx.tar.gz`, `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz`. Other kernel files are not required. If they exist at the same time, it will not affect the update. The system can accurately identify the required kernel files). The optional kernel supported by the device can be freely updated, such as from 5.10.125 kernel to 5.15.50 kernel.

## 11. Install common software

Login in to armbian → input command:

```yaml
armbian-software
```

Use the `armbian-software -u` command to update the local software center list. According to the user's demand feedback in the [Issue](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues), gradually integrate commonly used [software](../armbian-files/common-files/usr/share/ophub/armbian-software/software-list.conf) to achieve one-click install/update/uninstall and other shortcut operations. Including `docker images`, `desktop software`, `application services`, etc. See more [Description](armbian_software.md).

## 12. common problem

In the use of Armbian, some common problems that may be encountered are summarized below.

### 12.1 dtb and u-boot correspondence table for each box

Please refer to [Description](amlogic_model_database.md)

### 12.2 LED screen display control instructions

Please refer to [Description](led_screen_display_control.md)

### 12.3 How to restore the original Android TV system

Usually use armbian-ddbr backup to restore, or use Amlogic usb burning tool to restore the original Android TV system.

#### 12.3.1 Restoring using armbian-ddbr backup

It is recommended that you make a backup of the original Android TV system that comes with the current box before installing the Armbian system in a new box, so that you can use it when you need to restore the system. Please boot the Armbian system from `TF/SD/USB`, enter the `armbian-ddbr` command, and then enter `b` according to the prompts to backup the system. The backup file is stored in the path `/ddbr/BACKUP-arm-64-emmc. img.gz` , please download and save. When you need to restore the Android TV system, upload the previously backed up files to the same path of the `TF/SD/USB` device, enter the `armbian-ddbr` command, and then enter `r` according to the prompt to restore the system.

#### 12.3.2 Restoring with Amlogic usb burning tool

- Under normal circumstances, re-insert the USB hard disk and install it again.

- If you cannot start the Armbian system from the USB hard disk again, connect the Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes to the computer monitor. If the screen is completely black and there is nothing, you need to restore the Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes to factory settings first, and then reinstall it. First download the [amlogic_usb_burning_tool](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools) system recovery tool and install it. Prepare a [USB dual male data cable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/159267576-74ad69a5-b6fc-489d-b1a6-0f8f8ff28634.png), Prepare a [paper clip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/159267790-38cf4681-6827-4cb6-86b2-19c7f1943342.png).

- Take x96max+ as an example. Find the two [short-circuit points](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/110590933-67785300-81b3-11eb-9860-986ef35dca7d.jpg) on the motherboard, Download the [Android TV firmware](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools). The Android TV system firmware of other common devices and the corresponding short circuit diagrams can also be [downloaded and viewed here](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools).

```
Operation method:

1. Open the USB Burning Tool:
   [ File → Import image ]: X96Max_Plus2_20191213-1457_ATV9_davietPDA_v1.5.img
   [ Check ]：Erase flash
   [ Check ]：Erase bootloader
   Click the [ Start ] button
2. Use a [ paper clip ] to connect the [ two shorting points ] on the main board of the box,
   and use a [ USB dual male data cable ] to connect the [ box ] to the [ computer ] at the same time.
3. Loosen the short contact after seeing the [ progress bar moving ].
4. After the [ progress bar is 100% ], the restoration of the original Android TV system is completed.
   Click [ stop ], unplug the [ USB male-to-male data cable ] and [ power ].
5. If the progress bar is interrupted, repeat the above steps until it succeeds.
   If the progress bar does not respond after the short-circuit, plug in the [ power ] supply after the short-circuit.
   Generally, there is no need to plug in the power supply.
```

When the factory reset is completed, the box has been restored to the Android TV system, and other operations to install the Armbian system are the same as the requirements when you installed the system for the first time before, just do it again.

### 12.4 Set the box to boot from USB/TF/SD

- Write the firmware to USB/TF/SD, insert it into the box after writing.
- Open the developer mode: Settings → About this machine → Version number (for example: X96max plus...), click on the version number for 5 times in quick succession, See the prompt of `Enable Developer Mode` displayed by the system.
- Turn on USB debugging: System → Advanced options → Developer options again (after entering, confirm that the status is on, and the `USB debugging` status in the list is also on). Enable `ADB` debugging.
- Install ADB tools: Download [adb](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/tag/tools) and unzip it, copy the three files `adb.exe`, `AdbWinApi.dll`, and `AdbWinUsbApi.dll` to the two files `system32` and `syswow64` under the directory of `c://windows/` Folder, then open the `cmd` command panel, use `adb --version` command, if it is displayed, it is ready to use.
- Enter the `cmd` command mode. Enter the `adb connect 192.168.1.137` command (the ip is modified according to your box, and you can check it in the router device connected to the box), If the link is successful, it will display `connected to 192.168.1.137:5555`
- Enter the `adb shell reboot update` command, the box will restart and boot from the USB/TF/SD you inserted, access the firmware IP address from a browser, or SSH to enter the firmware.

### 12.5 Disable infrared receiver

Support for the infrared receiver is enabled by default but if you are using your TV box as a server then you may wish to disable the IR kernel module to prevent switching your TV box off by mistake. To completely disable IR, add the line:

```yaml
blacklist meson_ir
```

to `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` and reboot.

### 12.6 Selection of bootstrap file

- Of the currently known devices, only a few devices such as `T95(s905x)` / `T95Z-Plus(s912)` / `BesTV-R3300L(s905l-b)` need to use the `/bootfs/extlinux/extlinux.conf` file, it has been added by default in the firmware. For other devices, if necessary, you can write the Armbian firmware to the USB, double-click to open the `boot` partition, and delete the `.bak` in the `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf.bak` file name that comes with the firmware to use it. `armbian-install` automatically checks when writing to eMMC and creates an `extlinux.conf` file if it exists.

- Other devices only need `/boot/uEnv.txt` to boot, do not modify the `extlinux.conf.bak` file.

### 12.7 Network settings

The default content of the network configuration file `/etc/network/interfaces` is as follows:

```yaml
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
# Network is managed by Network manager
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```

#### 12.7.1 Dynamic IP address assignment by DHCP

```yaml
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

#### 12.7.2 Manually set a static IP address

The IP, gateway and DNS are modified according to your own network conditions.

```yaml
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
```

#### 12.7.3 Use OpenWrt in docker to establish interworking network

The MAC address in it can be modified according to your needs.

```yaml
source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

allow-hotplug eth0
no-auto-down eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

auto macvlan
iface macvlan inet dhcp
        pre-up ip link add macvlan link eth0 type macvlan mode bridge
        post-down ip link del macvlan link eth0 type macvlan mode bridge

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```

### 12.8 How to add startup tasks

A custom startup task script file has been added to the system, and the path in the Armbian system is [/etc/custom_service/start_service.sh](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/custom_service/start_service.sh) file, you can customize and add related tasks in this script according to your personal needs.

### 12.9 How to update service scripts in the system

Use the `armbian-sync` command to update all service scripts on the local system to the latest version.


### 12.10 How to obtain Android partition info on eMMC

When writing the Armbian system onto eMMC where Android system resides, you need to confirm the Android system partition table of the device beforehand, to ensure that the data is written to a safe area, and try not to damage the Android system partition table, so as to avoid problems such as the system not being able to boot. If you write to an unsafe area, you will either not be able to start, or get an error similar to the following:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187075834-4ac40263-52ae-4538-a4b1-d6f0d5b9c856.png">
</div>

#### 12.10.1 To obain the partition info

If you're using Armbian released in this repo after Nov.2022, you can copy&paste the following command to get a URL that records the whole partition info (the device itself does not need to be online)

```
ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode webreport 2>/dev/null
```

*The webreport mode of ampart was added in the v1.2 version released on Feb 3rd 2022, if the above command outputs nothing, then the built-in ampart in your installation is probably older than this. You could use the following command instead:*

```
echo "https://7ji.github.io/ampart-web-reporter/?dsnapshot=$(ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode dsnapshot 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)&esnapshot=$(ampart /dev/mmcblk2 --mode esnapshot 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)"
```

The URL should look like this：

```
https://7ji.github.io/ampart-web-reporter/?esnapshot=bootloader:0:4194304:0%20reserved:37748736:67108864:0%20cache:113246208:754974720:2%20env:876609536:8388608:0%20logo:893386752:33554432:1%20recovery:935329792:33554432:1%20rsv:977272832:8388608:1%20tee:994050048:8388608:1%20crypt:1010827264:33554432:1%20misc:1052770304:33554432:1%20instaboot:1094713344:536870912:1%20boot:1639972864:33554432:1%20system:1681915904:1073741824:1%20params:2764046336:67108864:2%20bootfiles:2839543808:754974720:2%20data:3602907136:4131389440:4&dsnapshot=logo::33554432:1%20recovery::33554432:1%20rsv::8388608:1%20tee::8388608:1%20crypt::33554432:1%20misc::33554432:1%20instaboot::536870912:1%20boot::33554432:1%20system::1073741824:1%20cache::536870912:2%20params::67108864:2%20data::-1:4
```

Copy the URL to your browser to open it, and you will see well-formatted DTB partition info and eMMC partition info：

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24390674/216287642-e1b7be27-4d2c-4ac3-9fcc-15e06aebb97e.png">
<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24390674/216287654-d1929e21-d2b3-4fb6-bcf0-c454c88e21b9.png">
</div>

#### 12.10.2 To share the partition info

When sharing the partition info to others (e.g. to post it to this repo to get a new device supported, or to get help from others), always prefer the URL itself than a screenshot of the opened webpage. If a long URL annoys you, you could always use some free URL shortener

 - On one hand, the partition infos on the webpage are actually generated on each access, so notes about whether some partitions could be written to and the format of the table could change
 - On the other hand, it's very inconvenient to get the number from a screenshot to do some calculations

Addtionally, you do not need to prepare/post a spreadsheet file, either. The layout on the webpage is designed speciially so any one could just copy&paste to Excel or LibreOffice Calc if they really need a spreadsheet.

#### 12.10.3 To understand the partition info

The DTB table represents the partition layout the **firmware** on the box wants, recorded in the Android DTB, usually ends with a auto-fill `data` partition, so the layout here could be same across all of the boxes that share the same firmware (therefore certainly the same model). The actual partition layout, though, will be different depending on the capacity of the eMMC, but it's always decided by the DTB partition layout (so you could always deduct the eMMC partition layout from a certain DTB partition layout and the capacity. *The above DTB partition info and eMMC partition info did not come from the same box, could you notice why?*)

The eMMC table represents the actual eMMC partition layout, in which in row represents an area, each of the area could be either a partition, or a gap between partitions (Amlogic's quirks again, they decided to leave at least a 8M gap between partitions for possible usage in the future, yet never use it, even on their newest S905X4). The lines that represent partitions have black text color and have values in their offset and masks columns; the lines that represent gaps have grey text color and have no values in their offset and masks columns.

The last column in each row of the eMMC table marks the writable status of the area. A green `yes` means you can safely write to it; a red `no` means you should never write to it; a yellow note means writable on some conditions, or only partially writable.

Take the above table for example, the `bootloader` partition's 0+4M (`0M~4M`) is not writable; the 32M gap (`4M~36M`) after it is writable; the `reserved` partition's `36M+64M` (`36M~100M`) is not writable; then all until the `env` partition is writable (`100M~836M`); the `env` partition's 1M afterwards is writable (`837M~end`). Then all possible writable areas on eMMC are:

- 4M~36M
- 100M~836M
- 837M~end

If Android logo is still needed, then `logo` partition's 852M+32M (852M~884M) is not writable. Then all possible writable areas on eMMC are：

- 4M~36M
- 100M~836M
- 837M~852M
- 884M~end

#### 12.10.4 To be used on eMMC installation

If eMMC installation on the device using `armbian-install` with `-a yes` fails (which will use [ampart](https://github.com/7Ji/ampart) to adjust the eMMC partition layout automatically), then the optimal eMMC partition layout could not be applied on your box (i.e. the DTB partitions will be reduced to auto-filling `data` only, then eMMC partition layout will be generated from this, then still existing partitions will be moved as to the beginning of eMMC as possible, so all area after 117M became writable), you will need to modify the partition info in [armbian-install](../armbian-files/common-files/usr/sbin/armbian-install).

There are 3 key arguments about the partition layout in the file: `BLANK1`, `BOOT`, `BLANK2`. In which, `BLANK1` stands for the area that can't be used from the beginning of the eMMC; `BOOT` stands for the area that could be used to store the kernel, dtbs, etc after `BLANK1`, better not smaller than 256M; `BLANK2` stands for the area that can't be used after `BOOT`; All areas after `BOOT` will be used to create a `ROOT` partition to store all of the data outside of `/boot`. All of the three arguments should be integer, and the unit isMiB (1 MiB = 1024 KiB = 1024^2 Byte)

Consider the above situation where we don't need a `logo` partition. We surely want to utilize all of the space, yet `4M~36M` is too small to be used for `BOOT` so we have to include it in the unusable `BLANK1`. The `100M~836M` then is well enough for `BOOT` so it could take all of it. The unusable `836M~837M` then goes to `BLANK2`. The arguments then should be like the following (an example for `s905x3`, adapt it to other SoCs when editting):

```shell
# Set partition size (Unit: MiB)
elif [[ "${AMLOGIC_SOC}" == "s905x3" ]]; then
    BLANK1="100"
    BOOT="736"
    BLANK2="1"
```

### 12.11 How to make u-boot file

The u-boot file is an important file to guide the system to start normally.

#### 12.11.1 Extract the bootloader and dtb files

Extraction requires the use of HxD software. You can download it from [Official website download link](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) or [Backup download link](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/releases/download/tools/HxDSetup.2.5.0.0.zip) to get the installation.

Execute the following commands in sequence in the `cmd` panel to extract the relevant files and download them to the local computer.

```shell
# use the adb tool to enter the box
adb connect 192.168.1.111
adb shell

# export bootloader command
dd if=/dev/block/bootloader of=/data/local/bootloader.bin

# export dtb command
cat /dev/dtb >/data/local/mybox.dtb

# export gpio command
cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio >/data/local/mybox_gpio.txt

# Download the bootloader, dtb and gpio files to your local computer
adb pull /data/local/bootloader.bin C:\mybox
adb pull /data/local/mybox.dtb C:\mybox
adb pull /data/local/mybox_gpio.txt C:\mybox
```

#### 12.11.2 Make the acs.bin file

The most important part of the mainline u-boot is acs.bin, which is used to initialize the memory. The original u-boot is located in the first 4MB of the firmware. Extract the `acs.bin` file using the `bootloader.bin` file you just obtained.

Open HxD software, open the `bootloader.bin` file exported above, `right click - select range`, start position `F200`, length `1000`, select `hexadecimal`.

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056711-1b58ce71-2a7d-4e9b-a976-e5f278edaa53.png">

Copy the selected result, then create a new file, paste insert, ignore warnings, save as acs.bin file.

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056725-0a0e60af-6a21-4a6b-a2d5-f3d46b438a6a.png">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056827-8419c738-3428-473e-9a95-ab7270170d98.png">
<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187056852-9f62f16a-f7f1-4c34-a2c2-78358d198f9a.png">
</div>

If the bootloader is locked, the code in this area is garbled and useless. Normally, there should be a lot of `0` as shown in the above picture, and `cfg` will appear several times in a row, and the words related to `ddr` will appear in the middle. This kind of normal code can be used.

#### 12.11.3 Make the u-boot file

To make u-boot, you need https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip and https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot two source libraries, and compile the two u-boot files of your own box .

In the amlogic-boot-fip source code, only the acs.bin file is different for each model, and other files can be used in common.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/187057209-c4716384-46ef-4922-9710-8da7ae6db1e4.png">

For the method of making u-boot, please refer to the specific instructions in https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/doc/board/amlogic, and select the model of your own device to compile and test.

To make u-boot according to the method of [unifreq](https://github.com/unifreq), you need to use the acs.bin, dts and config files of the box. The dts exported from the Android system cannot be directly converted into the Armbian format, and you need to write a corresponding dts file yourself. According to the different parts of the specific hardware of your own equipment, such as switches, LEDs, power control, tf cards, sdio wifi modules, etc., use the similar [dts](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y/tree/main/arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic) file in the kernel source library for modification and production.

Take the u-boot for X96Max Plus as an example:

```shell
~/make-uboot

- Download the [amlogic-boot-fip](https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip) source code. Create the [x96max-plus](https://github.com/unifreq/amlogic-boot-fip/tree/master/x96max-plus) directory in the root directory. Except for the `asc.bin` file made by yourself, other files can be copied from other directories.
- Download [u-boot](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot) source code. Make the corresponding [x96max-plus_defconfig](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/configs/x96max-plus_defconfig) file and put it in the [configs](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/configs) directory. Make the corresponding [meson-sm1-x96-max-plus-u-boot.dtsi](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/meson-sm1-x96-max-plus-u-boot.dtsi) and [meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dts](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dts) file and put it in the [arch/arm/dts](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/tree/master/arch/arm/dts) directory, and edit the [Makefile](https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/Makefile) file in this directory to add the index of the `meson-sm1-x96-max-plus.dtb` file.
- Go to the root directory of the u-boot source code directory and follow the steps in the document https://github.com/unifreq/u-boot/blob/master/doc/board/amlogic/x96max-plus.rst

There are two types of final generated files: the `u-boot.bin` file in the u-boot root directory is the incomplete version of u-boot used in the `/boot` directory (corresponding to [overload](../amlogic-u-boot/overload) directory); `u-boot.bin` and `u-boot.bin.sd.bin` in the `fip` directory are the full version u-boot files used in the `/usr/lib/u-boot/` directory (corresponding to [bootloader](../amlogic-u-boot/bootloader/) directory), the difference between the two files of the full version is 512 bytes, and the larger one is filled with 512 bytes of 0 in front.

💡Tip: Before writing to eMMC for testing, please check the Brick Rescue Method in 12.3. Be sure to master the position of the short contact, have the original Android system file in .img format, and perform a short-circuit flash test to ensure that the brick-rescue method has been mastered before writing the test.

### 12.12 Memory size recognition error

If the memory size is incorrectly recognized (1-2G is not normal for 4G memory, and 3.7G is normal), you can try to manually copy a `/boot/UBOOT_OVERLOAD` file (note that it is a `copy`, `not renaming`, after renaming It will not boot after install and update operations), save as `/boot/u-boot.ext` when using in `USB`, and save as `/boot/u-boot.emmc` when using in `eMMC`.

Don't copy the u-boot file manually, except to try to solve the memory problem, adding it incorrectly will result in failure to boot and various problems.

### 12.13 How to decompile a dtb file

Some new devices are not in the current support list (or have variants), you can try by decompiling and adjusting related parameters.

```shell
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y device-tree-compiler

# 1. Decompile command (use dtb file to generate dts source code)
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o xxx.dts xxx.dtb

# 2. Compile command (use dts to compile to generate dtb file)
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o xxx.dtb xxx.dts
```

### 12.14 How to modify cmdline settings

In Amlogic devices, settings such as adding/modifying/deleting can be done in the `/boot/uEnv.txt` file. On Rockchip devices this is set in the `/boot/armbianEnv.txt` file. A reboot is required after each change to take effect.

For example, the `Home Assistant Supervisor` application only supports the `docker cgroup v1` version, and currently docker installs the latest v2 version by default. If you need to switch to v1 version, you can add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` parameter setting in cmdline, and you can switch to `docker cgroup v1` version after restarting.

### 12.15 How to add new supported devices

To build an Armbian system for a device, you need to use four parts: `device configuration file`, `system files`, `u-boot files`, and `process control files`. The specific adding methods are as follows:

#### 12.15.1 Add device profile

In the configuration file [/etc/model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf), add the corresponding configuration information according to the test support of the device. Where the value of `BUILD` is `yes`, it is part of the devices built by default, and the corresponding `BOARD` value `must be unique`, these boxes can directly use the Armbian system built by default.

The default value is `no` and there is no packaging. When using these devices, you need to download the same `FAMILY` Armbian system. After writing to `USB`, you can open the `boot partition in USB` on the computer and modify `FDT dtb name` in `/boot/uEnv.txt` file, other devices in the adaptation list.

#### 12.15.2 Add system files

The common files are placed in the directory `build-armbian/armbian-files/common-files`, common to all platforms.

The platform files are placed in the `build-armbian/armbian-files/platform-files/<platform>` directory, [Amlogic](../armbian-files/platform-files/amlogic), [Rockchip](../ armbian-files/platform-files/rockchip) and [Allwinner](../armbian-files/platform-files/allwinner) respectively share the files of their respective platforms, where the `bootfs` directory is the file of the /boot partition, The `rootfs` directory contains the Armbian system files.

If individual devices have special differential setting requirements, add an independent directory named `BOARD` under the `build-armbian/armbian-files/different-files` directory, and create the `bootfs` directory to add the relevant files under the system `/boot` partition as needed, Create a `rootfs` directory to add system files as needed. The name of each folder is based on the actual path in the `Armian` system. It is used to add new files or overwrite files with the same name added from the general files and platform files.

#### 12.15.3 Add u-boot files

`Amlogic` series devices share the [bootloader](../u-boot/amlogic/bootloader/) files and [u-boot](../u-boot/amlogic/overload) files. If there is a new file, respectively into the corresponding directory. The `bootloader` files will be automatically added to the `/usr/lib/u-boot` directory of the Armbian system when the system is built, and the `u-boot` files will be automatically added to the `/boot` directory.

For `Rockchip` and `Allwinner` series devices, add an independent [u-boot](../u-boot) file directory named after `BOARD` for each device. The corresponding series of files are placed in this directory.

When building an Armenian image, these u-boot files will be written into the corresponding Armbian image file by the rebuild script according to the configuration in [/etc/model_database.conf](../armbian-files/common-files/etc/model_database.conf).

#### 12.15.4 Add process control files

Add the corresponding `BOARD` option to `armbian_board` in [yml workflow control file](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml), which supports the use in `Actions` of github.com.

### 12.16 12.16 How to fix I/O errors when writing to eMMC

Some devices can start Armbian normally from USB/SD/TF, but will report I/O error when writing to eMMC, such as [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues/989), the error content is as follows:

```shell
[  284.338449] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.341544] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
[  284.446972] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.450074] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
[  284.497746] I/O error, dev mmcblk2, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
[  284.500871] Buffer I/O error on dev mmcblk2, logical block 0, lost async page write
```

In this case, you can adjust the working mode speed and frequency of the dtb used to stabilize the read and write support for storage. When using sdr mode, the frequency is 2 times the speed, and when using ddr mode, the frequency is equal to the speed. as follows:

```shell
sd-uhs-sdr12
sd-uhs-sdr25
sd-uhs-sdr50
sd-uhs-ddr50
sd-uhs-sdr104

max-frequency = <208000000>;
```

Take the code snippet in the [dts](https://github.com/unifreq/linux-5.15.y/tree/main/arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic) file of the kernel source code as an example:

```shell
/* SD card */
&sd_emmc_b {
	status = "okay";

	bus-width = <4>;
	cap-sd-highspeed;
	sd-uhs-sdr12;
	sd-uhs-sdr25;
	sd-uhs-sdr50;
	max-frequency = <100000000>;
};

/* eMMC */
&sd_emmc_c {
	status = "okay";

	bus-width = <8>;
	cap-mmc-highspeed;
	max-frequency = <100000000>;
};
```

Generally, the problem can be solved by reducing the frequency of `&sd_emmc_c` from `max-frequency = <200000000>;` to `max-frequency = <100000000>;`. If it doesn’t work, you can continue to lower it to `50000000` for testing, and adjust `&sd_emmc_b` to set `USB/SD/TF`, or use `sd-uhs-sdr` to limit the speed. You can get the test file by modifying the dts file and [compiling](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/compile-kernel) it, or you can decompile and modify the existing dtb file to generate the test file by the method introduced in `Chapter 12.13`. The decompiled dtb file is modified using hexadecimal values, where the hexadecimal value of `200000000` in decimal is `0xbebc200`, the hexadecimal value of `100000000` in decimal is `0x5f5e100`, the hexadecimal value of `50000000` in decimal is `0x2faf080`, and the hexadecimal value of `25000000` in decimal is `0x17d7840`.

In addition to solving problems through the system software layer, you can also use [money ability](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/issues/998) and [hands-on ability](https://www.right.com.cn/forum/thread-901586-1-1.html) to solve.
