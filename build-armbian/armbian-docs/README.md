# Use GitHub Actions to compile Armbian

View Chinese description  |  [查看中文说明](README.cn.md)

`GitHub Actions` is a service launched by `Microsoft`. It provides a virtual server environment with very good performance configuration. Based on it, projects can be built, tested, packaged, and deployed. The public repository can be used for free without time limit, and the single compilation time is up to `6 hours`, which is enough for compiling  `Armbian` (we can usually complete a compilation in about `3 hours`). Sharing is only for the exchange of experience. Please understand the deficiencies. Please do not initiate various bad attacks on the Internet, and do not maliciously use it.

## 1. Register your own GitHub account

Register your own account, so that you can continue to customize the firmware. Click the `Sign up` button in the upper right corner of the `giuhub.com` website and follow the prompts to `register your account`.

## 2. Set the privacy variable GitHub_TOKEN

Set the GitHub privacy variable `GitHub_TOKEN`. After the firmware is compiled, we need to upload the firmware to `GitHub Releases`. We set this variable according to the official requirements of GitHub. The method is as follows:
`Personal center`: `Settings` > `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Generate new token` ( Name: `GitHub_TOKEN`, Select: `public_repo` ). `Other options` can be selected according to your needs. Submit and save, copy the `Encrypted KEY Value` generated by the system, and `save it` to your computer's notepad first. This value will be used in the next step. The icons are as follows:

## 4. Personalized Armbian firmware customization file description

The firmware compilation process is controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. There are other `yml files` in the `workflows` directory to achieve other different functions. When compiling the firmware, the Armbian official current code is used for real-time compilation, and the relevant parameters can be found in the official documentation.

```yaml
- name: Compile Armbian [ ${{ env.ARMBIAN_BOARD }} ]
  id: compile
  run: |
    cd build/
    sudo chmod +x compile.sh
    sudo ./compile.sh BRANCH=${{ env.ARMBIAN_BRANCH }} RELEASE=${{ env.ARMBIAN_RELEASE }} BOARD=${{ env.ARMBIAN_BOARD }} \
                      BUILD_MINIMAL=no BUILD_DESKTOP=no HOST=armbian KERNEL_ONLY=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
                      CLEAN_LEVEL=make,debs COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha
    echo "::set-output name=status::success"
```

## 5. Compile the firmware

There are many ways to compile firmware, you can set timed compilation, manual compilation, or set some specific events to trigger compilation. Let's start with simple operations.

### 5.1 Manual compilation

In the `navigation bar of your repository`, click the `Actions` button, and then click `Build armbian` > `Run workflow` > `Run workflow` to start the compilation, wait about `3 hours`, and complete the compilation after all the processes are over. The icons are as follows:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163203938-e7762b09-e6b8-4cf5-b1f1-9c67c1a29953.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204044-9c7a7429-47ee-4fce-b7dd-e217bebf6133.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204127-6b16b558-7e78-4c22-a28a-7b37b5a34fa3.png width="300" />
</div>

### 5.2 Compile at the agreed time

In the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file, use `cron` to set the timing compilation. The 5 different positions represent min (0 - 59) / hour (0 - 23) / day of month (1 - 31) / month (1 - 12) / day of week (0 - 6)(Sunday - Saturday). Set the time by modifying the values of different positions. The system uses `UTC standard time` by default, please convert it according to the time zone of your country.

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 17 * * *'
```

## 6. Save the firmware

The settings saved by the firmware are also controlled in the [.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml](../../.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) file. We will automatically upload the compiled firmware to the `Actions` and `Releases` officially provided by `GitHub` through scripts, or upload it to a `third party` (such as WeTransfer).

Now the longest storage period of `Actions in GitHub is 90 days`, `Releases is permanent`, and third parties such as WeTransfer are 7 days. First of all, we thank these service providers for their free support, but we also ask you to use it sparingly. We advocate the reasonable use of free services.

### 6.1 Save to GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Upload artifact to Actions
  uses: kittaakos/upload-artifact-as-is@master
  if: steps.build.outputs.status == 'success' && env.UPLOAD_FIRMWARE == 'true' && !cancelled()
  with:
    path: ${{ env.FILEPATH }}/
```

### 6.2 Save to GitHub Releases

```yaml
- name: Upload Armbian Firmware to Release
  uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
  if: steps.build.outputs.status == 'success' && env.UPLOAD_RELEASE == 'true' && !cancelled()
  with:
    tag: Armbian_${{ env.FILE_DATE }}
    artifacts: ${{ env.FILEPATH }}/*
    allowUpdates: true
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    body: |
      This is Armbian firmware for Amlogic s9xxx tv box
      * Firmware information
      Default username: root
      Default password: 1234
```
### 6.3 Save to a third party

```yaml
- name: Upload Armbian Firmware to WeTransfer
  if: steps.build.outputs.status == 'success' && env.UPLOAD_WETRANSFER == 'true' && !cancelled()
  run: |
    curl -fsSL git.io/file-transfer | sh
    ./transfer wet -s -p 16 --no-progress ${{ env.FILEPATH }}/Armbian_* 2>&1 | tee wetransfer.log
    echo "WET_URL=$(cat wetransfer.log | grep https | cut -f3 -d" ")" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

## 7. Download the firmware

Enter from the GitHub `Releases` section at the bottom right corner of the `repository homepage`, and select the firmware corresponding to the model of your `Amlogic s9xxx tv box`. The icons are as follows:

<div style="width:100%;margin-top:40px;margin:5px;">
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204798-0d98524c-73df-4876-8912-fcae2845fbba.png width="300" />
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/163204879-4898babf-fa00-4e63-89ea-235129e2ce1d.png width="300" />
</div>

## 8. Install Armbian to EMMC

Login in to armbian (default user: root, default password: 1234) → input command:

```yaml
armbian-install
```

The mainline u-boot is installed by default, In order to support the use of 5.10 and above kernels. If you choose not to install, specify it in the `1` input parameter, e.g. `armbian-install no`

## 9. Update Armbian Kernel

Login in to armbian → input command:

```yaml
# Run as root user (sudo -i)
# If no other parameters are specified, the following update command will update to the latest version of the current kernel of the same series.
armbian-update
```

If there is a set of kernel files in the current directory, it will be updated with the kernel in the current directory (The 4 kernel files required for the update are `header-xxx.tar.gz`, `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-amlogic-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz`. Other kernel files are not required. If they exist at the same time, it will not affect the update. The system can accurately identify the required kernel files). If there is no kernel file in the current directory, it will query and download the latest kernel of the same series from the server for update. You can also query the [optional kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable) version and update the specified version: `armbian-update 5.4.180`. The optional kernel supported by the device can be freely updated, such as from 5.4.180 kernel to 5.15.25 kernel. When the kernel is updated, By default, download from [stable](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable) kernel version branch, if you download other [version branch](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub), please specify according to the branch folder name in the `2` parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.7.19 dev` . The mainline u-boot will be installed automatically by default, which has better support for kernels using versions above 5.10. If you choose not to install, please specify it in the `3` input parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.4.180 stable no `

The `headers` files in the kernel is installed in the `/use/local/include` directory. When compiling the application, add `-I /usr/local/include` to the `CFLAG` parameter of `GCC` to find the headers files.

The kernel update script will be continuously updated during development. You can use this command to update the local script synchronously: `wget -O /usr/sbin/armbian-update git.io/armbian-update` . Or directly use the latest script on the server side to update the kernel: `bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/armbian-update) 5.4.180`

## 10. common problem

In the use of Armbian, some common problems that may be encountered are summarized below.

### 10.1 dtb and u-boot correspondence table for each box

Please refer to [Description](config_correspondence_of_amlogic_s9xxx_tv_box.md)

### 10.2 How to restore the original Android TV system

Please refer to [Description](how_to_restore_the_original_android_tv_system.md)

### 10.3 LED screen display control instructions

Please refer to [Description](led_screen_display_control.md)

### 10.4 Set the box to boot from USB/TF/SD

Please refer to [Description](set_the_box_to_boot_from_usb_tf_sd.md)

### 10.5 Disable infrared receiver

Support for the infrared receiver is enabled by default but if you are using your TV box as a server then you may wish to disable the IR kernel module to prevent switching your box off by mistake. To completely disable IR, add the line:

```yaml
blacklist meson_ir
```

to `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` and reboot.
